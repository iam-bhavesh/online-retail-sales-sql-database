# Online Retail Sales Database & Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive SQL database for an online retail company. It covers essential business processes including product management, customer orders, inventory handling, and sales analytics. The goal is to demonstrate database design, complex SQL queries, and real-world business cases.

## Technology Stack
- SQL: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (adaptable)
- SQL scripts for database schema, sample data insertion, and queries

## Database Schema
The database includes the following tables and relationships:

- **Categories:** CategoryID, CategoryName
- **Suppliers:** SupplierID, Name, ContactInfo
- **Products:** ProductID, Name, CategoryID, Price, SupplierID, Stock, Rating
- **Customers:** CustomerID, Name, Email, City, RegistrationDate
- **Orders:** OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
- **OrderDetails:** OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice
- **Reviews:** ReviewID, ProductID, CustomerID, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate

Relationships:
- Each order belongs to one customer.
- Orders contain multiple products via OrderDetails.
- Products belong to categories and suppliers.
- Customers can leave product reviews.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install a SQL database system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
2. Run the script `schema.sql` to create the database and tables.
3. Run `insert_sample_data.sql` to populate sample data for testing.
4. Use `query_examples.sql` to explore sample queries demonstrating analytics and data retrieval.

## Sample Queries
- List all products under a specific category.
- Find the top 5 best-selling products by quantity sold.
- Retrieve monthly sales totals and revenue.
- Display purchase history for individual customers.
- Calculate average product rating from reviews.
- Identify products with low stock levels.
